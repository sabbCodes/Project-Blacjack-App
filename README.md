# Project-Blackack-App

I built this Blackjack game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The goal is to get a sum of "21" however one can.
Once user gets 21 points, the user wins.
It gives users random cards ranging from 1 - 13, with 1 = Ace, 11 = Jack, 12 = King and 13 = Queen.
It sums these numbers up and display them in the approprite location.
It also takes name input from user and display name while game has started.
It moves the appropriate cards into the cards stage.
User can't click START GAME button while previous game hasn't ended.
User can't click on NEW CARD button while out of game.
At the end of the game, if the user wins, a confetti animation will be played.
